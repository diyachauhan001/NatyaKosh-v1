Console-based Student Management System built using Java

Natya Kosha is a console-based Student Management System built using Java. 
It supports CRUD operations such as adding students, enrolling them in courses, viewing details, and managing tuition payments. 
I used Java OOP concepts like classes, constructors, static variables for unique IDs, and ArrayList for in-memory data storage. 
The project follows separation of concerns by handling business logic in a service class.
